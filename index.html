    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <div class="aboutme">
      <p>Hi! My name is Reece Maruyama. I am in the class of 2026 at Waipahu High School. I am currently in the Academy of Industrial Engineering Technology which has provided me with a strong foundation in computer principles and problem-solving skills. As I look toward the future, I plan to pursue a major in Computer Science with hopes of becoming a Graphic Designer. I believe that the knowledge and skills I am gaining through my coursework and extracurricular activities will help me achieve this goal. Throughout high school, I played 4 years of Baseball and studied Cybersecurity in the AOIT pathway. Outside of academics and athletics, I enjoy working out, playing video games, watching TV, and listening to music. I am excited to continue growing academically and personally, and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead as I work toward achieving my dreams.</p>
